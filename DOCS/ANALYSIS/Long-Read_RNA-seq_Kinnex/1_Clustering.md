# Read Clustering

In this step, the pipeline generates high-quality consensus transcript sequences from Full Length Non Chimeric (FLNC) reads. It accepts and processes one or multiple FLNC BAM files in a single run, producing a unified output. The consensus transcripts are used in downstream alignment, collapsing, and quantification.

## Clustering FLNC Reads

##### Generate high-quality consensus transcripts

```text
isoseq cluster2 --singletons flnc.fofn transcripts.bam
```

Arguments:

- *flnc.fofn*: a file-of-filenames (FOFN) listing the FLNC BAM files to be processed together.
- *-\-singletons*: includes low-abundance transcripts supported by fewer than two FLNC reads, which are typically excluded. This allows retention of rare transcript isoforms that might still be biologically relevant.

## Implementation with IsoSeq

The pipeline uses [IsoSeq](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq) version 4.2.0.

## Source Code

All the relevant code can be accessed in the GitHub repository:
